# Nextjs Application Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Template Application with all the basic functionalities like authentication and authorization along with user management and dashbord for each user. This template uses `Nextjs app router` for the `fullstack` application with [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an `ORM`. For the development `sqlite` database is configured for the easy development process, however we can change that to use full blown database server supported by the `prisma` just changing two lines as describe below. This is not any fully developed project but instead is a basic starter template using the underlying technologies explained.
